# Canvas Projects

This repository holds a series of short projects that I did to get familiar with the HTML5 Canvas.
So far, these are:

* [Clock](https://davidthaler.github.io/canvas/clock.html) - An old-fashioned clock with hands
* [Canvas](https://davidthaler.github.io/canvas/canvas.html) - A simple sketching program. It includes color and line width selection, allows loading of a background image and has basic undo functionality.
* [Mobile Canvas](https://davidthaler.github.io/canvas/mobileCanvas.html) - a version of canvas for mobile that uses touchstart/touchmove events instead of mouse events.
