# Canvas Projects

This repository holds a series of short projects that I did to get familiar with the HTML5 Canvas.
So far, these are:

* [Clock](davidthaler.github.io/canvas/clock.html) - a simple clock with hands
* [Canvas](davidthaler.github.io/canvas/canvas.html) - about the simplest drawing program I can think of. Drag the mouse to draw.
* [Mobile Canvas](davidthaler.github.io/canvas/mobileCanvas.html) - a version of canvas for mobile that uses touchstart/touchmove events instead of mouse events.

This content is served from [here](davidthaler.github.io/canvas) on Github Pages.
